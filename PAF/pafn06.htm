<blockquote><p>History of Clara Ludlow Hawkins<br>
Written in 1945</p>
<p>Clara Ludlow Hawkins was born June 8, 1875, in Halifax England.  A daughter of Paul and Elizabeth Dixon Ludlow.  Paul being one of the children of Nathaniel and May Ann Niblet Ludlow.  The entire family belonged to the Church of England but was converted to the Mormon Church by missionaries.  Nathaniel and his wife and their older son Enoch and his wife came to Utah three years before Paul and family, Paul being in ill health at the time.<br>
     They left England in the year 1879 with a family of four girls, Mary Ann, Amelia, Clara, and Emily.  They had already buried 3 girls in infancy in England before leaving.  They left their comfortable home and possessions in England bringing only a few articles they treasured.  Among them being some bedding, and a flock bed where they packed some dishes, brass teakettle and a set of beautiful Crystal luster’s, which her mother had received as a gift.  Some of these articles Clara still has.<br>
     They arrived in the United States by boat in the summer, landing in New York, being six weeks on the ocean.  From there they traveled by train to Salt Lake City where they were met by Nathaniel and Enoch.  They traveled to Benjamin in a wagon.  Their first home was built of logs on the farm now owned by Bertha Angus Jones.  Later they built a two-room adobe home from the earnings of Mary Ann the eldest daughter who worked in Salt Lake City.<br>
     In this home two more daughters were born, Annie and Alena making a total of nine girls.  With this large family they went through many hardships.  The father still being in ill health died when Alena was nine months old.  Enoch living near by gave them aid and always treated them as a father.  They walked and carried water from a spring near Arrowhead resort, a distance of 2 ½ miles.  They gathered Greasewoods to burn for fuel and cooking.  Clara had to earn money for her schooling and walked from her home 3 miles to the little adobe school house near the Benjamin cross roads.  There she completed the 4th grade, which was the amount of her schooling.  As a child Clara and sisters would walk to see their grandparents Ludlow, whose home was near where Clarence Beckstrom now lives.  They would follow the trodden path through the greasewoods.  One time as she and Amelia were going home in the evening they came to play house made from grease woods, and as they came closer they could see two bright sunbonnets that had been left there hanging on one of the bushes.  They not having any bonnets themselves tried them on and were so delighted with them they decided to take them home.  When they arrived their mother noticed the bright bonnet on each head and, even feeling the longing the girls had for them asked where they had received them.  Answering their mother to the affect that they had found them and hoping she would let them keep the bonnets they heard her say,  “the bonnets do not belong to you, so therefore, you must return them to the place where you found them.”<br>
     By this time it was almost dark and the girls were frightened because in those days the country was big and open at night.  The coyotes howled at night making it very scary. They ran all the way through the lonely trail.  Clara, being the younger, fell down several times and was chided by her sister.  To this day she remembers the lesson learned from this incident.<br>
     As a small girl, Clara worked for her Uncle Enoch and Aunt Lavinia doing housework, picking fruit and berries and in return would be given food for the pay.<br>
     During her teenage years recreation was very limited, as she had to work most of the time.  Dancing and horseback riding was the main sport as even buggies were scarce in those days.  In the simmer they would go to the lake for a swim clothed in long dresses and stockings.<br>
     She has often told the story, (during her courting days with Charles); they were riding in a two-wheel cart to a celebration leading a racehorse that Charles was going to ride in the races later that day.  As they traveled along the horse pulled away from them.  They had to run the horse down before they could catch it.  As a result from that the horse was so tired that it lost the race.  They all blamed the loss on Clara.<br>
     Bishop A.J.B. Stewart married her at a young age to Charles Eli Hawkins, in the year 1892.  The marriage was later solemnized in the Salt Lake Temple.<br>
     From this union 13 children were born.  Paul, Fametta, Bertha, Heber, Maynard, Ivan, Ray, James, Emma, William Lester, Alice, Eva and Clara.  Fametta died in infancy. Heber died at the age of 8.  Maynard at the age of 14 when he was killed falling from a load of hay and having the wagon run over him.  Alice died in womanhood after the birth of her son Starr H. Brockbank.  Clara and Charles took him and raised him as their own.  Starr served his country in Okinawa during the 2nd world war.  Clara also raised, to adulthood, Elijah, Charles young brother, after his mother died.<br>
     In her early-married life, Clara lived on the Hawkins ranch located in the northwest part of Benjamin.  She would stay home with the children while Charles went working in the mines, playing in an orchestra and bands, etc. which he did to earn a living for the family.<br>
     She worked in the fields besides milking 8 cows night and morning.  She always took pride in keeping a neat and clean home.  She would scrub the wooden floors until she could obtain enough rags to have a carpet made of this she was very proud.  She did the washing for her large family on a scrubbing board.  Each bed had a straw tick that was filled with fresh straw after the threshing was done in the fall.  She took great pains filling it so it would not be uneven.  She sewed for her children many times making over clothes and remodeling one to the other.<br>
     Her ability to do things is numerous, and her entire life has been spent doing little things well done that go to making a good and successful life.<br>
     In the year 1906 her husband was called to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church, laboring in California.  This left her with a tremendous responsibility keeping the home together and caring for the six children and baby Emma soon to be born.<br>
     At this time an example of her faith and courage was displayed.  She obtained ten acres of ground through her father’s estate.  This was covered with greasewoods.  She and her older children dug the grease woods by hand to burn for home use and when her husband returned the ground was cleared and ready for farming.<br>
     Many trials had confronted her but she never gave up and her life has been an inspiration to her children, to her many friends by her willingness to work and help others.<br>
     After her husband returned from his mission in 1908 they began a new life together, planning and struggling but most of the time, successful in every thing they undertook to do.  Four more children were born to them, and through it all they were able to obtain enough means to build the brick home where they still live and which will always be home to their family.<br>
     She served as President of Religion Class for a short time and later worked in Primary for 8 years.  At the time the Benjamin Chapel was built everyone gave their Sunday eggs toward the building fund.  She and Mrs. Bingham were chosen to gather the eggs by way of horse and buggy.  Then they would take them to David Hone Store and receive cash for them.<br>
     She has worked as a block teacher for the Relief Society most of her married life.  Many times being called to care for the sick, also helping to take care and dress the dead, before the time of morticians.  On four different occasions she played the part as Doctor to women who were unable to secure a Doctor when their babies were born.<br>
     Her last child was born when she was 47 years old, since that time she has continually devoted her love and time to her family.  Many times going without herself in order to give to her children.<br>
     She moved to Provo for ten years during the time her husband served as County Assessor.  Also of interest to her family was the fact she was the first woman juror in the State of Utah.  Her hobby in her late years has been making quilts and braided rugs.  Each of her children has received a beautiful quilt upon their marriage, she having corded the wool for the bats herself for many of the quilts.  She has given quilts to most of her grandchildren.<br>
     She is very proud of her large family, especially was she proud of having three sons in the Bishopric at one time.  She has truly been a wonderful mother always living the principles of the gospel and the teaching of it to her children.  Her efforts have been worthwhile as all of her children have been through the temple.<br>
     She was a great lover of flowers, and in the summer she spent most of her time outside in her garden among many varieties, which made her home beautiful to look at.  She had a rose garden that each of her children contributed to she named each after them.<br>
     In the winter one could see her windows full of beautiful potted plants, which she enjoyed taking care of.  Nothing pleased her more than to be able to share her flowers with others.<br>
     Clara was blessed with good health most of her life, and as a result her life has been spent doing for others always enjoying company preparing food and entertainment to make them welcome in her home.<br>
     At the age of seventy she had the misfortune of breaking her foot while working in her garden.  That was the first and only time she was ever confined to a hospital.  It was feared she may never walk again but courage, and faith, and a strong desire to walk helped and in a few months she was again on her feet enjoying taking care of and cooking for her family.<br>
     Her greatest attributes were her love for her husband, her children, and her family, neighbors and friends.  Her generosity has endeared her to all who came in contact with her.</p>
