<blockquote><p>See mother (jml:e4) Elizabeth's note for some questions surrounding the possible identity of this George.  In 1871 England census George (and Elizabeth) are living with an aunt and uncle (Hannah and Thomas Ludlow, he is Elizabeth's oldest brother).  In 1881 census George was first listed as a "grandson" of Hannah Ludlow (a widow and "head" of family), but that word is crossed-out and the relationship of "nephew" is written-in.  For occupation, he is listed as an "Ag. Lab." (agricultural labourer).<br>
In Minchinhampton's parish register, George Henry Ludlow was christened on 4 July 1869; he was shown as the son of a "single woman", Elizabeth Ludlow, abode "Burnt Ash" (item 1844, page 231).<br>
In the 2nd quarter of 1888, a George Henry Ludlow married an Amelia CURTIS in the Stroud, Gloucs registration district.  In the 1891 census, a George H. and Amelia "SUDLOW" family is listed in the index.  He was born about 1869 in Minchinhampton! -- same George but under an odd surname.  A close look of the photocopy of the census page reveals how the "L" could have been mistaken as an "S".  He is listed as a "Wood Turner".  In 1901 census, George and Amelia now have five living children (+ one other possible deceased child -- see file) and he is listed as a "Market Gardener", living close to his step-father, James Humphries, in Hampton Field, Minchinhampton.</p>
