<p>Judy Edwards April 2006:  Annie Mitchell her name looks like it could be Arnil in the 1891 census but in close examination it is Annie also in 1901 it is plain to see that her name is Annie. Also in the british civil records it shows that William Henry Ludlow was married to Ann Maria Hopes not Annie Mitchell she goes by Annie in the 1871 census records. I have changed my records to Ann Maria Hopes. I do not know how I got the name of Mitchell it was a mistake. I am glad to have this brought to my attention. I will be making changes for temple work to be done.</p>
