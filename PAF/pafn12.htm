<blockquote><p>Written History of Ivan Hawkins<br>
Born December 5, 1901</p>
<p>One Cold winter night December 5, 1901, I was born to Charles Eli and Clara Ludlow Hawking in a log home where the Don Ludlow home now stands.  I was the 6th child in a family of 13.  Paul, Fametta, Bertha, Heber, Maynard, Ivan, Ray, James Oscar, Emma Levern, William Lester, Mary Alice, Eva, and Clara.  They also raised a grandson Starr H. Brockbank who was the son of Alice.  Heber died at the age of 8 and Fametta at 3.<br>
     Mother said I was a healthy baby so I was not much trouble.  I wore dresses till I was 2 years old, which was the custom at that time.  Then I wore pants just below the knees with elastic at the bottom.  I had my first long pants just before I was ordained a Deacon.<br>
     The spring of 1902 we moved on Grandfathers farm and lived in a large two-story adobe home.  Father believed in teaching his children obedience and so he started while we were in the high chair.  We soon learned that we were to mind what he said.  I was all-most 7 years old when I started school because my birthday was Dec. 5th.<br>
     In the fall of 1906 father bought 10 acres of ground from Ben Davis and moved a two-roomed house on it.  We all had chores to do and I started to milk cows when I was 5 years old along with other little jobs.  I learned to work when I was real young.  That same year 1906 my father was called on a mission for the Church.  He did not want to go and leave his little family along with a farm mortgage to pay off.  But my mother insisted that he go because she knew that the Lord would bless our family.  It was very hard for her because she was expecting a baby.  The Lord did bless our family a great deal because when he got home she handed him the paid off mortgage to the farm.<br>
     One day when I was in the 1st grade I did not want to go to school.  I told my mother that I had a stomach ache so she gave me a big spoon of castor oil and made me go to school anyway.  About 9 a.m. I asked my teacher if I could go to the bathroom, which was out side along a fence.  A little later I asked her if I could go again but she would not let me thinking I was just making excuses to leave.  Well I had a very bad accident in my pants.  She put a note in an envelope and had me take it home to my mother.  I can still see how mother laughed and that broke me of playing sick anymore.<br>
     All through school my grades were average.  I seldom got less than 100% in arithmetic. It seemed I was always in mischief.  One day with three other boys we played hooky from school and the next morning we were called in to Mr. Walker’s office and put over his knee and got a good licking with a willow.  Our games at school were springing lopes, playing marbles and baseball.<br>
I went to Benjamin till the 8th grade then I attended the Spanish Fork High School.  I played baseball and football.  We left home at 7 a.m. in a covered wagon with a stove to keep us warm in the winter months.  Sometimes the snowdrifts were so deep all us had to get out of the wagon and help push the horses.  We would leave for school in the dark and some times get home in the dark.<br>
     There were about 16 kids born in the town of Benjamin in one year so we had lots of fun parties in the winter.  We would go skating and sleigh riding. The girls would fix a basket of food for two and the boys would draw numbers to see what girl he would eat lunch with.  That was always the best of the party because we all liked to eat.<br>
     When I was about 16 I started to herd sheep with Mr. Schonsfield at Diamond Mountain.  We lived in a tent.  He always got up early to go with the sheep. One morning when he came in for breakfast, a Rattle Snake was coiled up on his bed.  He got a club and killed it and then showed me what I was sleeping with.  It had 12 rattlers one for each year that it had lived.  That same year, a Cougar killed my pony.  When I was 17 years old I took a mule up to the mine in Mammoth for Jessie Knight.   While I was there, it was during the flu epidemic and so I was quarantined there, so I bought me a big horse. I worked for several years in various jobs along with my brothers traveling to Eureka and Idaho.<br>
     When I was 20 I meet my wife Edith Simmons.  I courted her in a new buggy and fancy horse that I had bought.  After about a year and a half we decided to get married.  So in September 28, 1921 we were married in the Salt Lake Temple.  That night I had to hurry home to milk the cows.  Later we had a reception in the old dance hall and danced till 4 a.m.  The first few years of our married life was pretty hard trying to pay all our bills.  In 1923 we bought a Model Tee Ford for 35 dollars.  It was one that you had to crank to get started.  We had lots of fun times with our other married friends.  We had ward dances and had parties at each other’s homes.<br>
     When we were first married I wanted to raise cattle so my father bought me 35 head of cows.  I ran out of feed so I let them loose in another field and 11 of them died because they blotted.  I decided I was not cut out for cows so I traded in the rest for sheep and have had them ever since.<br>
     With a few exceptions (working at a pipe plant and in a mine) I have farmed all my life.  We have two living children, Junior & Lois and many grandchildren and great grandchildren.  I have had a full and wonderful life.</p>

<blockquote><p>                                     Written History of Edith Simmons Hawkins</p>
<p>     The date of my birth is June 5, 1903.  There was no doctor present and the name of the mid-wife, if there was one was not known to me.  James Calvin and Arletta Cloward Simmons had already been blessed with eight other children.  The brothers and sisters who awaited my birth in the small home were: Charles Ivan, Vivaretta, Lenora Alean, Henry Darwin, and Rebecca.  Just two years after by birth, the tenth child was born.  His name was LaVon Cloward and we became great friends.  My oldest brother, William Calvin, had died at the age of one.  Leona Devina had been stricken with small pox when she was six and James Bernard had passed away before he was a year old.<br>
     The humble home in which I was born has a very interesting history.  There were three small bedrooms, a living room and kitchen.  It originally was one of the first log cabins built in Payson by my great grandfather Cloward.  Improvements and additions were made.  Lumber was milled and placed over the logs and the roof was shingled,  But electricity and running water were unheard of until many years later.<br>
       Our home was very small, but it was a happy one.  There was always someone to play with and I could feel the love my mother and father shared for each other.  My father earned money to support his large family by going to the mountains and getting poles and then selling them for lumber and fences.  He was gone a great deal of the time and his homecoming was anticipated with much joy.  He would always have a treat left in his lunch pail for the little children.<br>
     The greatest tragedy of my childhood struck our home swiftly one March morning, when I was only 4 ½ years old.  We were all sitting eating breakfast and father just fell from his chair.  Mother had a sister that lived next door, and my brother ran to get her.  Together they finally got father into bed.  The doctor came and diagnosed the case.  Father had suffered a stroke at the age of 38.  I have only a very few memories of my father.  I remember the night stand by his bed filled with medicine bottles.  He died in the night a short time after his stroke.  The morning after he had died, I went into the back bedroom and found his body laid out on a sheet on boards supported by two chairs.  I have no memory of him ever holding me on hid lap, or even being kissed by him.  I am sure that he did love me and did hold me, but I have only the memories of his illness and death.  I loved my father mainly because of the stories told about him by my mother and older brothers and sisters.  I have never missed one decoration day since his death without putting flowers on his grave.<br>
     Mother and Father had a special kind of love for one another and his death left mother drained both emotionally and physically.  She for a time didn’t want to live and laid on her bed not caring about anything.  But after a time, she realized that her life must go on for the sake of her seven children.<br>
     The income, which had been small in the beginning was now nonexistent.  She did have a home and a large yard which held fruit trees and berry bushes.  Her main source of income was from the washings she did for others.  Each night all of the children would draw the water from the deep well and we would fill everything we could find with water.  We would have to get up very early to pound all the clothes with a steel plunger before going to school.  The plunger looked like a bathroom plunger,  but it was much larger and it was made of steel.  We would pound the clothes to get them clean in a big tub of water.  Several years later we bought a washing machine that had a handle on the side that would have to be pushed from one side to the other to make the dolly inside turn and wash the clothes.  After school we would deliver the clean folded clothes to the clients.  Von and I would each take a handle of the basket and walk along the sidewalk delivering the washings.  Taking in washings was a job that we were ashamed of and we didn’t want the towns people to know that this was how we earned our money.  The streets were lined with big poplar trees.  If we heard or saw anyone coming along the walk, we would hide with our basket behind the trees until they were gone.  We did this for many years.<br>
    Times were difficult, but there were good fun times too.  One time, my sister Reba and some other girls ran away from me.  I was so small and short legged that I couldn’t keep up.  I finally found them in an old out house.  I banged on the door and put together my first real sentence,  “You shammy little shusses is hid from me.”  Reba grabbed me by the hand and took me to mother screaming “Edith can talk, Edith can talk.<br>
     My aunt Lot hand a beautiful flower garden, and she would make big sprays of flowers for us to sell.  At that time Eureka was a boom town and the depot was filled with passengers waiting to go to the mining town.  We would get as much as five or six dollars for a spray of flowers and we never did have to bring any flowers back home.  Aunt Lot would give Von and I twenty five cents a piece for selling the flowers and we thought we were very rich.<br>
     My first school was the old Central School across the street from the park.  My first school teacher Mrs. Curtis was very plain and I went home several nights and cried because my teacher was so ugly.  I wanted a pretty teacher.  Mother gave a licken and lecture on the truth that beauty is only skin deep.<br>
     Out school lessons were done on the big table in the living room by candle light.  I remember how excited we all were when Mother bought our first oil lamps.  This made it so much lighter in our home at night and it was such a thrill to watch them burn.<br>
     We had so much fun in the winter time sleigh riding.  Near our home were four hills just right for coasting.  The big boys would help us pull the sleds up the hills.  On a really good day we could slide all the way from the old high school to our front door.<br>
     The morning of my birthday in June 1911 was to be the day of my baptism.  My older brothers and sisters took me to the font which had been made in the Payson creek.  The water frightened me so that I refused to go in.  We all came back home and on the following Fast day morning we went again to the font.  I wouldn’t get into the water the second time.  When the fourth trip was going to be made mother warned me that this was the last time she was going to send me.  On June 2 1912 I was baptized by Owen L. Barnett and I was confirmed the same day in the Payson second ward.  It took almost a year, but I was finally able to overcome my fear of the font.  I guess you could say I was less afraid of the font than I was my mother.<br>
     I have hated strawberries all of my life.  It isn’t that I really don’t like the taste of the berries it is just that I hate toads.  Our patch was full of toads when I was small and every time I go to eat a strawberry I think of the toads and it ruins the taste for me.<br>
     My fear of the water has caused me much embarrassment.  When we got a little older we were allowed to go to Springlake to swim.  The water was crystal clear and very cold.  I was so afraid, but I went with Reba any way.  Reba was a good swimmer and loved to dive.  When she would get on the board to dive into the water, I would start to scream “Come up, Come up.”  I would keep screaming until she was safely out of the water.  Finally my big sister told me that I could no longer go with her and her friends to Springlake, and I would have to find someone my own age to play with.<br>
     Ethel Frisby became my very good friend and she and I played many hours with safe things like hollyhock dolls.  The many colored hollyhocks were the skirts and wild currant, picked from the fence and pinned in place, served as the head.  We would fill a wash tub with water and float to dolls.  We could change the dolls gowns to a different color and the dolls would float and glide on the surface of the water.<br>
     We had few dolls and so my friend and I would play with cats and pretend they were dolls.  I didn’t like to hold the cats, so my friend would wrap their legs all up in a towel and pin it tight with a safety pin until all you could see was the cats head.  I am sure the cats hated to play house with us, but we had a wonderful time.<br>
     We had a cemetery for all the dead animals we found.  We would bury the animals then we would make grave markers out of wood and place flowers on the grave.  Our cemetery for animals was used through out my whole childhood.<br>
     I can’t really think of a terribly mean thing I did as a child.  I do remember taking the gate form the fence of one home and then carrying it several blocks away and leaving it on Halloween night.  I also remember going to Salem and swiping watermelons.<br>
     I started school at Central, but most of the primary grades I attended were at the Peteetneet.  This school is at least two miles from where I lived.  The walk was long on warm days, but in the winter it was very long.  We got so cold and the teachers wouldn’t let us in to get warm when we arrived, but made us wait outside for the bell.<br>
     In the higher grades at the Peteetneet we would have little parties on Friday night at the different homes of the students.  We would play games such as climb the Cherry Tree and Paint the Plow.  The boy would sit on top of a small ladder or on the back of a high backed chair.  The girl would then climb the imaginary cherry tree and the boy would reach down and give her a smack.  When you painted the plow, the boy would sit on a chair and the girl would sit on one knee.  He would kiss her on one check and then as the game progressed, she would move to the other knee and the other cheek would be painted.<br>
     Every Sunday afternoon we would have a candy pull and make taffy.<br>
I graduated from the Eighth grad at the Peteetneet and went on to high school.  By this time my older brothers and sisters had married or were working and had moved away from home.  Mother got a job as a Milner making hats at the Wilson Style Shop.  My sister Reba was working as a clerk in a dry goods store, so the cooking and cleaning fell on my shoulders.  I would have to hurry home from school to fix supper.  While they worked on Saturday I would clean the house and do the laundry.<br>
     At the age of fifteen, I was allowed to attend the dances on Saturday night.  Mother was a beautiful seamstress and she helped us make our dresses.  She also made us hats to match.  After the clothes were completed, the Simmons girls and their mother, acting as a chaperone, would attend the dances in style.<br>
     The dances were held not only in Payson but in all the surrounding small and larger towns.  The dance hall in Spanish Fork was in the park.  There were springs built under the floor so that as the music played and the dancer danced the floor would sway with the music.<br>
     One Sunday afternoon my girl friend and I went down to the rail road and walked the tracks.  We walked a long way and ended up in Benjamin.  The two of us started back to Payson and decided to take the road home.  We hadn’t gone very far when a horse and buggy approached going in our direction.  The fellows inside asked if we could use a<br>
ride.  Our legs were so tired from walking that we agreed.  Since there were two boys and two girls, we paired up for the rest of the day.  I went with Bill Hone and Ellavee went with Ivan Hawkins.<br>
     The next Sunday on the lawn of the tabernacle the four of us decided to trade dates.  Ivan became my date for the day.  Our love grew and soon Ivan Hawkins became the one and only in my life.  We went together for the rest of the summer and on September 28, 1921 we were married in the Salt Lake Temple.<br>
     We had a big wedding reception in the Benjamin dance hall.  It was a wonderful party.<br>
A luncheon of sandwiches, potato salad, pickles, cheese, and punch was served to all the guests.  Grandmother Hawkins prepared the wedding lunch and also made the wedding cake with the help of her daughter Berths.  The wedding cake was cut into individualized pieces and wrapped in was paper and tied with pink bows.  The cake was then placed in a large wicker basket and the basket was decorated with pink and white ribbon.  Ivan and I took the basket around the hall and gave a piece of cake to each of our guests.  Everyone danced until 2:00 a.m. and it took until 6:00 a.m. to see that everyone was home safe.<br>
     Our first home was a little two room house.  We had a lamp for light and we had to carry the water from a big flowing well outside.  The first two years were hard for me.  I would get so homesick that I would walk to Payson.  Ivan and I had a horse and buggy, but I didn’t like the horse.  I would walk rather than be afraid of the horse all the way to Payson and back.<br>
     Not long after we were married we were invited to a big party.  The roads were so bad that the only way we could get there was on horse back.  I had a new dress for the party and I rode on the back of the horse behind Ivan. As we got almost to our destination the horse stumbled and I was thrown over the horse’s head and landed in a huge mud puddle.  We came back home and I cried for hours over my dress, the party and my pride.  The next day I burned the dress,  It was ruined beyond repair.<br>
    We wanted children so very badly but even though we tried I lost the first four babies.  The albumin in my kidneys caused so many problems.  Three times I miscarried because of my condition.  Finally I had a full term baby boy that was born dead.  I would have what they called uric acid convulsions.  The doctor said that if I ever got pregnant again I would lose my life.  I would hemorrhage after each pregnancy until I would almost bleed to death.  I got pregnant one more time.  When my mother heard about this pregnancy she took me to the Salt Lake Temple.  I was given a special blessing by the sisters and was promised that with this baby things would be all right.  I had convulsions all the time I carried the baby, but the baby was born healthy and weighted eight pounds.  We named our long awaited first child Junior Charles.  He was born May 6, 1926.<br>
     Two years later we had a beautiful baby girl.  There were problems with this pregnancy as well but we had been blessed with the children promised me in the special blessing in the temple.  Lois Marie was born March 22, 1928.<br>
     We had a hard life on the farm.  At one time I had 21 baby lambs that needed to be fed on the bottle three times a day.  I also had a coop full of chickens which were my responsibility.  The eggs would go to the store to buy the things we needed such as groceries and items for the house.<br>
     We tried other means of employment in the first years of our marriage.  We moved to Mammoth where Ivan worked in the mines for a winter.  We lived for a while in Springville while Ivan worked at the pipe factory.<br>
     We decided to come back to the farm and try to make a living for us and to help Ivan’s parents with the work.  We have lived in Benjamin on the farm for fifty five years.  It has been a good life but sometimes the lack of sufficient income has made it very difficult.<br>
     We went through the depression on the farm.  It is hard to believe that money was so scarce that a two cent stamp was hard to buy to mail a letter.  We did everything we could to earn money during those hard times.  We had string bean patch. We would pick the beans every two days and then take them to the cannery to sell.<br>
     We have many friends.  When we were young we would dance and party as much as three or four times a week.  I belonged to a ladies club that would beet every two weeks.  We would play cards and eat our meat at a restaurant.  I attended this club for fifty five years but so many of the ladies have passed away that the club is no longer held.<br>
     Ivan and I have always been active in the church.  I was the first Religion Class President in the Benjamin Ward.  I taught Sunday School for twenty six years,  was in the primary presidency, and I have served as a visiting teacher in the Relief Society for many years.  I have been a member of the Benjamin Daughters of the Pioneers and served as Captain twice.<br>
     I think perhaps the greatest trial of my life has been the fight for my health.  There has been a constant stream of doctors, hospitals, medicine, and pain.  Many times it seemed that I wouldn’t recover.  The power of the priesthood, modern medicine, good nutrition, and the care of my family have helped me with this struggle.<br>
     My children have been the source of much of the joy and pride of my life.  Our lives have been very close to our children and grandchildren.  The holidays and special occasions are always spent together and each time I see all of our beautiful posterity, I thank the Lord for his bounteous blessings.</p>
