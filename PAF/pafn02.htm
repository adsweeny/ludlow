<p>3. <a href="pafg02.htm#98" name="98"><b>Hannah Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Information about Hannah and her children was obtained on her death certificate that was issued in 1883 in the District of Hawthorn colony of Victoria.<br>
listed children and ages of her children at the time of her death.<br>
Also listed was the years that she had been in Australia which was listed as 25 years at the time of her death. She went to Australia around 1858</p>
<p>BIOGRAPHY: Hannah's husband, William DYER, was an agricultural laborer, like Hannah's father.<br>
They lived in Avening and had at least four daughters. When the 1851 census was conducted, two of<br>
their daughters were staying with Hannah's parents. The Dyers sailed from Plymouth, England on<br>
Mar. 28, 1857 and arrived in Melbourne on the ship Tudor on June 30, 1857. They settled in<br>
Hawthorn (also spelled Hawthorne, near Melbourne), Victoria, Australia where William died in 1863.<br>
Hannah remarried and had one daughter with George Benjamin Baker. Hannah died in Australia at<br>
age 65 leaving behind five daughters and hopefully some posterity in Australia.</p>
<p>Hannah was probably born between Aug 1818 and Aug 1819 as she was 25 at the time of her marriage on 21 Aug 1843.<br>
No record of any issue between 1 Jan 1859 and 31 Dec 1871.</p>
<p>Daniel H. Ludlow has a copy of Hannah's death certificate (#1811) shows:  died 16 Jan 1883 at Hawthorn  age 65, with John Ludlow, brother, Hill Street, was informant; buried in Boroondara cemetery 17 Jan 1883; survivors were Fanny 39, Mary Ann 37, Ellen 35, and Harriett 33 from first marriage and Eliza 18 from second marriage.</p>
<p>Daniel H. Ludlow has a copy of the birth certificate of Female Dyer born 16 May 1858, at Hawthorn, Victoria, daughter of William Dyer and Hannah Ludlow.  The birth record indicates William Dyer was about 36 and was born in Avening, England; Hannah Ludlow [Dyer] was about 38, born in Avening; their marriage was in 1843 at Avening.  They had, in 1858, 4 living children and 1 dead.</p>

<p>4. <a href="pafg02.htm#60" name="60"><b>Nathaniel Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the attractive features in the landscape near Spanish Fork is the highly improved farm of Enoch Ludlow, whose home is at Benjamin. He is one of the substantial citizens that England has furnished to Utah, his birth having occurred in Yorkshire on the 20th of January, 1853, his parents being Nathaniel and Mary Ann (Niblett) Ludlow. The father was a mason by trade, following that pursuit in England, where he also engaged in contracting. At length he determined to come to the new world and in September, 1878, arrived in Utah, bringing with him his wife and three children. The life record of Enoch Ludlow is the story of earnest endeavor, for when but seven years of age he began work in a woolen factory, where he was employed for seven years. He was afterward apprenticed to a butcher and for a short time before he came to the new world he owned and operated a shop devoted to the manufacture of sausage, but having embraced the faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the family decided to cast in their lot with the people of that religious belief in Utah. For sixteen years the father remained a resident of this state, passing away in 1894 at the age of seventy-two years. He had been an active church worker and his business interests were those of farming. Since coming to Utah, Enoch Ludlow has given his time and energies to agricultural pursuits and is numbered among the ploneers of the vicinity of Spanish Fork. His brother Paul homesteaded in this district and Enoch Ludlow paid the costs of securing the homestead and became owner of the property. His first home was a log cabin and he also lived for a time in a dugout. He then built a residence of adobe brick, which was destroyed by fire in 1888, together with a granary that contained eight hundred bushels of grain, leaving Mr. Ludlow and his family without anything save the clothing which they wore. With characteristic energy, however, Mr. Ludlow faced the situation and at once began the building of a good brick residence, which he now occupies. As the years have passed he has continued his farm work with good success and in connection with his sons, Thomas E., Enoch, Jr., Richard and Fred, he is extensively interested in sheep and cattle raising, having two bands of sheep and thirtyfour hundred ewes. He also has sixty-five head of cattle on the range. There are large shade trees upon Mr. Ludlow's farm and it is one of the most attractive and beautiful places of the district. He has fifty acres in his home place and at one time was the owner of several hundred acres but has divided his holdings among his children. There are no modern improvements lacking upon his ranch, which has been brought to a very high state of cultivation. Upon it are all kinds of fruit and berries, which were planted by him. In 1872 Mr. Ludlow was married to Miss Levina Horsefall, a daughter of Richard Horsefall, who was a native of England, where he engaged in business as an architect. Mrs. Ludlow was the only one of her family to come to America and is the only one now living. By her marriage she became the mother of ten children, nine of whom survive, John having been accidentally killed when but eight years of age. The others are: Thomas E., Paul, Nathaniel, Jesse, Walter H., Enoch Jr, Richard, Fred and Priscilla. The last named is the wife of Moroni Bingham. All of the sons are farmers of Utah county, as is the husband of the daughter. There are now forty-one grandchildren and one great-grandchild. In the work of the church the family has taken a most active and helpful part. Mr. Ludlow served on a mission to England from 1904 until 1906 and had charge of the branch for a time. His son Paul was on a mission to the northern states and was president of the Illinois conference. Another son, Walter, was a traveling missionary in England for two years and Nathaniel also spent a similar period in that country in missionary work, while Enoch was recently on a mission to the southern states and was president of the Texas conference. Mr. Ludlow is president of the Seventy at Benjamin and is ward teacher. For twenty years he was choir leader and organized the Benjamin brass band, in which he played the tuba and drum. His children have inherited his musical talent and tastes and his son Paul was leader of the band, while Mr. Ludlow was its manager. All of the sons have farms of their own but work together more or less and Richard lives with his father upon the old homestead, while the others occupy homes of their own. In politics Mr. Ludlow is a democrat and keeps well informed on the questions and issues of the day, but the honors and emoluments of office have no attraction for him as he prefers to concentrate his efforts and attention upon other interests, especially his business and his church affairs.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Ludlow, the ancestor for whom the NLFHA (Nathaniel Ludlow Family<br>
Historical Association) was named, was nineteen years old when he married Mary Ann Niblett in<br>
1840. She and her family were instrumental when, three years later, they both joined the LDS church.<br>
Nathaniel was the first Ludlow ancestor who joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br>
Other family members later followed their example.<br>
Nathaniel worked as a shepherd and laborer in Avening until 1846 when they moved to Huddersfield,<br>
Yorks. They lived in Halifax, Yorks from 1850 until 1878, when they moved to Utah, USA. So far,<br>
he and his family have not been located in the 1851 or 1861 censuses of England because the records<br>
from Yorkshire are spotty. In the 1871 England Census, Nathaniel is living on St. James Rd. in<br>
Halifax as an excavator and "beer seller" with his wife and five younger children.<br>
On Sep. 14th, 1878, Nathaniel and Mary Ann, along with two of their sons (Enoch with his family,<br>
and young Walter), left England on the ship Wyoming. Eventually, five of their sons (Paul, Enoch,<br>
Moses, Albert and Walter) all resided in Utah. Their descendants (including Victor L. Ludlow, the<br>
researcher and compiler for this family record) have since spread throughout the United States.<br>
In the 1880 US Census, Nathaniel is listed as a "farmer" who had been temporarily disabled 4 months<br>
because of "rheumatism." Nathaniel worked at various jobs in Benjamin and Utah County prior to his<br>
death in 1893, age 72, in Benjamin, Utah.<br>
MISC: Nathaniel and five of his sons moved to the US. One son, Lorenzo, and two daughters, Rhoda<br>
Ellen "Isabella" Ludlow LUTY and Mary Jane Ludlow FRANKS CROWTHER, and their families<br>
remained in England. We have regular contact and visits with Lorenzo's descendants but not yet with<br>
Isabella's or Mary Jane's posterity.<br>
Two children, an earlier Rhoda Ellen and George, died young. The eldest son, John, apparently left<br>
home at an early age and his marriage, family and death have not yet been established.<br>

<p>LDS BAPTISM: Nathaniel, performed a "baptism for the dead" for his father John in the Logan<br>
Temple on 29 May 1888 (ordinance 2919, page 82 BYU Lib film #177,847) Apparently another<br>
baptism was performed for John on 12 Aug 1957 (where?)</p>

<p>5. <a href="pafg02.htm#99" name="99"><b>Daniel Saunders Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: Daniel was twenty-seven when he married Mary BAKER. Two years later, he was<br>
baptized a Mormon by Joseph Stay on March 20, 1851 at Nailsworth, a village northwest of Avening.<br>
Mary joined the church the next year. (Because no precise records of his LDS baptism remained, a<br>
vicarious baptism was performed on 12 Aug 1957 in the Salt Lake Temple.) They were members of<br>
the Chalford Branch, Cheltenham District until they were both "cut off" on Dec. 18th, 1853. In 1851<br>
England census, Daniel is listed as an agricultural laborer. In 1861 census he is a "farm shepherd;" in<br>
1871, a "farm labourer;" in 1881, a "shepherd;" in 1891, a "farm labourer." Mary was listed as a<br>
dress maker and later a turnpike keeper. They had two sons and three daughters. Daniel's oldest son,<br>
Alma, caused problems for the transcribers of the hand written census records; Alma is listed as<br>
"Almos" in the 1861 census, as "Alna" in 1871 census and as "Alma" in 1881 census.<br>
NOTE: Attempts are now being made to establish contact with some of Daniel's descendants who may<br>
still be living in England.<br>
MISC: Daniel was listed as a 28 year old "Ag Lab" (agricultural labourer" from Avening in the 1851<br>
England census of Minchinhampton, Gloucs. His wife Mary was a "Dressmaker" and they had a 10<br>
month old daughter, Emma, who was not listed in later censuses. In '61 census of Hyde area of<br>
Minchinhampton, he is listed as a 37 year old "Farm Shepherd" along with Mary and four children<br>
(Almos [Alma, a "Grocers Boy"], Amos [a "Scholar"], Emily [a 3 year old "Scholar"], and 9 month<br>
old Olife [Olive]). In '71 census, He is a "Farm Labourer" in Hyde, Minchinhampton with wife Mary<br>
(a "Turnpike Keeper) and four children (Alma [a "Stone Dresser"], Amos [a "Miller], Olive [a<br>
"Scholar"], and Mary Ann [a "Scholar"]).</p>

<p>6. <a href="pafg02.htm#100" name="100"><b>James Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>in 1891 census Fanny is living with daughter<br>
BIOGRAPHY: After James married Fanny PHELPS in 1846, he lived in the Hampton Field area of<br>
Minchinhampton near his brothers, Thomas and William. He worked as an acricultural laborer and<br>
later as a shepherd. He and Fanny had a large family of twelve children (six boys and six girls). Most<br>
of the children stayed in England, but the youngest daughter, Anna (Hannah), and her husband,<br>
Matthew IND, migrated to Australia. James was a member of the Avening LDS branch in 1847 and<br>
was listed in some district records, although there is no precise record of his baptism or later activity in<br>
Avening itself. It is also not known if Fanny ever became a Mormon. (Because no precise records of<br>
his LDS baptism remained, a vicarious baptism was performed on 12 Aug 1957 in the Salt Lake<br>
Temple.)<br>
In the 1851 England census of Minchinhampton, James is listed as a 26 year old agricultural labourer,<br>
born in Avening; in '61 census he is listed as a "Farmer's Carter", in 1871 as a "shepherd," and in 1881<br>
as a "Genl Labourer" (general labourer).<br>
NOTE: We are hoping to establish contact with what is probably a large posterity of James and Fanny<br>
Phelps LUDLOW.<br>
19 Sep 2005<br>
MISC: IGI and LDS Family Search records show James being christened in Avening, Gloucs, on 17<br>
Oct 1824. These records also show his marriage on 8 June 1846 in Minchinhampton, Gloucs, Eng.<br>
In England CRI, James Ludlow, age 64, died in the Stroud area and his death was registered during<br>
the first quarter of 1890. His wife, Fanny Ludlow, was listed as a widow in the 1891 England census.</p>

<p>7. <a href="pafg02.htm#441" name="441"><b>John Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: John was four days short of his 18th birthday when he was baptized a member of The<br>
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Oct. 21, 1844 by Job Salter (as recorded in the<br>
Chalford Branch records). He was confirmed two days later by Edward H. Webb. He then belonged<br>
to the Tetbury Branch, Bristol Conference. In a period of reformation, he was rebaptized and<br>
reconfirmed by Elder J. Gabb on May 4, 1847. J. Gabb also ordained him a priest on July 3, 1847.<br>
John appears to have been an active Latter-day Saint in the early 1850's. In 1852, he gave 2£ (the branch<br>
contribution average) and his younger sister, Charlotte, gave one shilling for an emigration fund to<br>
assist Latter-day Saints to travel to Utah. Later, he gave 4£ for the building of the Salt Lake Temple.<br>
(Because no precise original records of his LDS baptism remained, a vicarious baptism for John was<br>
performed on 12 Aug 1957 in the Salt Lake Temple.)<br>
John and his wife, Mary Ann UNDERHILL (she joined the church in 1848 and lived to the age of 95),<br>
migrated with three children to Victoria, Australia from Plymouth, England on Mar. 5, 1860 on the<br>
ship Atlanta and arrived in Melbourne on May 30th. Their first of thirteen children, a daughter, was<br>
named for John's sister, Charlotte. Their only son who grew to adulthood and had children was<br>
Charles. But Charles, in turn, only had daughters, so the LUDLOW surname did not carry on into<br>
Australia with the John Ludlow family line.<br>
NOTE: Although we have much information on John's descendants, we have had only limited indirect<br>
contact with some of John's descendants and we have not yet been able to establish regular direct<br>
contact with them.</p>
<p>Daniel H. Ludlow has a copy of John Ludlow's death certificate which reads:  died 14 Feb 1896 at Hill Street, Hawthorn, Victoria, at age 69, with grandson "Frederick John Ludlow Tidd" of Hill Street as informant; buried in Boroondara cemetery, surviving children:  Charlotte, 46; Charles 44, Emma 42.</p>

<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: After William married Eliza PULLIN in 1849, they lived in Hampton Field,<br>
Minchinhampton, next to his older brothers. He also was listed as an agricultural laborer in the 1851<br>
England census. He went to Victoria, Australia with his sister Hannah, arriving in Melbourne on the<br>
ship Tudor on June 30, 1857. William and Eliza had three daughters and a son before they left<br>
England and then another three daughters and a son after they arrived in Australia. Eliza died at age<br>
37 and William married Jane DOWNTON Godfrey (the surname of her first husband) and they had<br>
two more daughters and a son. William died young at the age of 48 and his brother John helped raise<br>
the children. In fact, these two families were so intertwined that some later descendants are not always sure<br>
whether they are descended from John or William. To complicate factors even more, William's and<br>
Eliza's youngest daughter, Maltilda (a good Aussie name), married Thomas Brown, the grandson of<br>
Hannah and William Dyer (Hannah was William's oldest sister).<br>
NOTE: The LUDLOW surname has carried on with William's descendants and we have established<br>
ties with some family members descended from William. Various Ludlow family members have<br>
visited each other both in Australia and in the United States.<br>

<p>10. <a href="pafg02.htm#104" name="104"><b>Charlotte Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: Charlotte was seventeen years old when she was baptized a Mormon on March 11,<br>
1851 by Richard Russell. With her older brother, John, she was active in the Tetbury Branch. In the<br>
early 1850's, she gave 2£ to the Salt Lake Temple fund. (Because no precise records of her LDS<br>
baptism remained, a vicarious baptism for her was performed on 4 Aug 1971 in the Salt Lake<br>
Temple.) There is no record of her church activity or where she resided after she married Jesse IND<br>
(or HIND) in 1854. He was a laborer.<br>
A son of theirs, Edward Hind, was five years old and listed as a "grandson" when he was staying with<br>
Charlotte's parents during the 1861 census in Avening. No further information or children have been<br>
found for Charlotte's family. There was speculation that she and Jesse may have migrated to<br>
Australia, but no definitive ties have been established anywhere, either in England or abroad.<br>
MISC: Sept '04 Used Ancestry.Com to search extensively for Jesse, Charlotte, and Edward Ind or<br>
Hind = only marriage of Jesse & Charlotte found in CRI (see photocopy of listing). Looked carefully<br>
in 71, 91, and 1901 censuses with no results. In Sep '05 checked 1861, '71, '81, '91' and 1901<br>
censuses under jes*, cha* and edw* IND & HIND and except for Edward Hind, age 5 staying with his<br>
grandparents John and Mary Ludlow in the 1861 census of Avening, Gloucs, Eng. could find NO<br>
other likely listing.<br>
In the 1851 census of Avening, "Charlotta" Ludlow is shown as a 17 year old agricultural labourer,<br>
born in Avening, staying with her parents, John and Mary Ludlow, and younger brother George and<br>
sister Harriet, and three nieces and one nephew.</p>
