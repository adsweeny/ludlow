<p>1. <a href="pafg01.htm#95" name="95"><b>John Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p> John LUDLOW was born in 1796 in Ashford, Kent (southeast England) where his<br>
father, Thomas, was serving as a British soldier in the North Gloucestershire Militia (Infantry).<br>
Before John turned three, his father was "missing-in-action" in a battle against the French Napoleon<br>
army in den Helder, Holland. John and his twice-widowed mother, Hannah Weight Clifford<br>
LUDLOW, returned to Avening, Gloucs (in the Cotswald Hills) where John later married Mary<br>
MATTHEWS in 1817. While raising his growing family, he joined his brother, Nathaniel, and two<br>
other men on Nov. 25, 1844 in petitioning the Bishop of Gloucester that a "room in the dwelling-house<br>
19 Sep 2005<br>
Accoring to John's son, Nathaniel, on information submitted for temple work in 1888, John's<br>
birthday was 15 Nov 1796, but no specific place of birth was identified. I think he assumed it was in<br>
Avening although the christening took place on Christmas day, 1796, in Ashford, Kent.<br>
CENSUS: The 1851 census of Avening (section II, #4) shows John, age 52 as an agricultural labourer<br>
having been born in ASHFORD, KENT! They have their three younger children living with them<br>
along with four grandchildren (two daughters of Mary Ann L. Dyer and a daughter and son of James).<br>
In 1861 England census, John "SUDLOW," age 63, born in "Kent, Ashford", is listed as a "Farm<br>
Labourer" in Avening records.<br>
In '71 census at Avening, he is listed simply as a 74 year old "Lab" (labourer), born in "Kent,<br>
Ashford".<br>
DEATH: When John died, he was living on St. James Rd, Halifax, Yorks. When Nathaniel did John's<br>
baptismal work in the Logan Temple, John's death date was listed as 27 Dec 1871.</p>

<p><a href="pafg01.htm#96" name="96"><b>Mary Matthews</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Mary MATTHEWS (also listed as MATTHEW) was born in 1797 in Avening,<br>
Gloucs, Eng. Her father, William, was fifty years old and married to his third wife, Miriam<br>
SAUNDERS. Mary was their seventh and next-to-last child. After Mary's marriage to John<br>
LUDLOW, she had eleven children over a twenty-one year period. Eight of these children reached<br>
maturity and married. In the 1851 census, her vocation was listed as "woolen cloth weaver." Unlike<br>
her husband, there is no record that she ever joined the LDS Church. Eight months after John's death<br>
(of apoplexy or a stroke while in Halifax, Yorks visiting Nathaniel's family), Mary suffered an<br>
accidental fall in Sep., 1872 and died in Avening. The parish register was more suggestive, stating<br>
that she "died from a fall when drunk." They were both 75 years old when they died.<br>
MISC: In 1861 England census, Mary "SUDLOW" (should be "Ludlow", see photocopy, but is listed<br>
as "Sudlow" in census index)is listed as a 63 year old "Farm Labourer's Wife", born in Avening,<br>
"GlocShire".</p>

<p>2. <a href="pafg01.htm#97" name="97"><b>Thomas Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: After Thomas married Hannah PHELPS, he lived in the Hampton Field section of<br>
Minchinhampton, the village just north of Avening. The "Old Hill" section of Avening, where the<br>
main Ludlow family resided, was located on the northern edge of Avening near the old parish chapel.<br>
MISC: In 1851 Minchinhampton census, Thomas (age 33) is shown as an agricultural labourer,<br>
having been born in Avening. By 1851, two younger brothers, James and William, lived in the same<br>
Hampton Field area. Like his father, Thomas worked as an agricultural laborer. In 1871, he was the<br>
innkeeper of the "Ragged Col. Inn" in Minchinhampton.<br>
19 Sep 2005<p>Thomas and Hannah apparently had no children, because none were listed in any records or with them<br>
in the censuses.</blockquote>

<p>11. <a href="pafg01.htm#105" name="105"><b>George Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: Somehow, George made the trip around 1858 to Hawthorn, Australia, where he<br>
worked as a laborer and died in 1864 at the age of 29. He was buried in Boroondara Cemetery,<br>
Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia (in the same burial plot where his siblings Hannah, John, and William<br>
would also be buried). He is listed as "unmarried" with "no issue" on his death certificate.<br>
MISC: In the 1851 Avening census, George Ludlow is shown as a 15 year old agricultural labourer.</blockquote>

<p>12. <a href="pafg01.htm#106" name="106"><b>Harriet Ludlow</b></a></p>
<blockquote><p>BIOGRAPHY: Harriet is listed in the 1851 census with her family in Avening as an 11 year old "cloth<br>
worker joiner." She died when she was only thirteen years old. She apparently died, at least in part,<br>
as a victim of her working in the textile industry.<br>
MISC: In the 1851 Avening census (two years before her death), Harriet is shown as an 11 year old<br>
"cloth worker joiner."<br>
